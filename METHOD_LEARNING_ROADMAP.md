- Generalized Fourier Slice Theorem (GFST) by Zhao et al. (2014)
- Rebinning transformation from fan to parallel beam

**Primary Resource:**
- **CRITICAL PAPER:** "Fan beam image reconstruction with generalized fourier slice theorem" by Zhao, Yang & Yang (2014)
  - Journal of X-Ray Science and Technology 22 (2014) 415–436
  - This is THE paper Michael Crum referenced
  - You now have the full PDF - read it 3+ times

**Key Insights from the Paper:**
1. **Standard Fourier Slice Theorem:**
   - Parallel beam: 1D FFT of projection = radial line in 2D FFT
   - Contribution: Single line through center

2. **GFST Extension:**
   - Fan beam: Contribution is a FAN REGION, not a line
   - Fan angle = 2 × γ_max (where γ_max relates to detector size)
   - Pole of fan is at center of Fourier domain
   - Add up ALL fan regions = complete 2D FFT

3. **Mathematical Core (Equation 19 from paper):**
   ```
   F(ηi, ηj) = Δβ Σ Π(γmax, γ(i,j,k)) · R(βk, D·tan(γ))
                    · exp[-jDη·sin(γ)] · D·cos(γ) · H(ηmax, η)
   ```
   Where:
   - R(βk, s) = fan beam projection data
   - β = scan angle
   - s = detector position
   - γ = fan span angle
   - D = source to rotation center distance

4. **Key Difference from FBP:**
   - GFST: Interpolation on projection data
   - FBP: Interpolation on filtered projection data
   - GFST: Filtering in Fourier domain (better for noise)
   - FBP: Ramp filter on projections

**Practice Tasks:**
1. Work through Equations 1-19 from the paper manually
2. Understand the rebinning transform (Equation 4)
3. Trace how one projection creates a fan region
4. Implement the MATLAB code provided in Section 7
5. Modify for string art geometry (arbitrary nail positions)

**String Art Connection:**
- Each string from nail A to nail B = one "projection"
- String angle relative to image center = projection angle β
- String brightness/opacity = projection intensity
- Goal: Find optimal strings whose fan regions sum to target image FFT

2. **Ignoring geometric interpretations** - Always visualize what transforms mean
3. **Not validating each step** - Test with simple cases (circles, squares) first
4. **Forgetting the discrete nature** - Continuous theory vs discrete implementation
5. **Underestimating complexity** - This is advanced material, take your time

## Final Notes

This is an **ambitious and advanced project**. The CT/FFT approach is theoretically elegant but practically complex. Be prepared to:

- Spend 3-4 months on learning before implementation
- Iterate multiple times on your algorithm
- Potentially fall back to the standard greedy algorithm if FFT approach proves too complex
- Combine both methods (use FFT for global optimization, greedy for fine details)

**Remember:** Understanding > Memorization. Focus on building intuition for each concept rather than just following formulas.

Good luck! This is cutting-edge algorithmic art research.
